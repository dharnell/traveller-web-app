## Installation

I used Laravel 10 + Vue JS

- Install git
- Clone the project
- Install Composer and run [composer install]
- Install Node JS
- Copy and rename the .env.example (Add necessary .env configuration see Runtime Error below)
- Go to project and run [php artisan serve] and run [npm run dev]
- No database needed

## Runtime Error
- Github warns me to not expose api keys and app id in publicly accessed github project (I've sent to Kristel Navarro my own Openweather API key and Foresquare App ID, if you do not have one.)
- Encountering error if no VITE_OPENWEATHER_APP_ID AND VITE_FORESQUARE_API_KEY set in .env
- Provide neccessary .env configuration.


## UI/UX Implementation

I used bootstrap + vue js for UI/UX, since bootstrap is always maintained and advancing I think it's a great tool for UI/UX design.
With the right usage of bootstrap and media query we can come up with a great design.
To be honest I'm a full stack web developer but more of a backend heavy.
