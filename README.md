## Installation

I used Laravel 10 + Vue JS

- Install git
- Clone the project
- Install Composer and run [composer install]
- Install Node JS
- If .env is not existing you can copy and rename the .env.example (Do not change any configuration)
- Go to project and run [php artisan serve] and run [npm run dev]
- No database needed since the exam is more of an API and web design


## UI/UX Implementation

I used bootstrap + vue js for UI/UX, since bootstrap is always maintained and advancing I think it's a great tool for UI/UX design.
With the right usage of bootstrap and media query we can come up with a great design.
To be honest I'm a full stack web developer but more of a backend heavy.
